Here’s a detailed **user story** and **requirements document** for your tennis unforced error tracking web app. This will help clarify the functionality, user interactions, and technical requirements for the project.

## **User Story**

### **As a Tennis Player, I Want to Track My Unforced Errors So That I Can Improve My Game**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - As a user, I want to sign up and log in to the app so that my data is secure and personalized.
   - As a user, I want to share my error data with my coach so that they can provide feedback.

2. **Session Management**:
   - As a user, I want to create a new session (e.g., match or practice) so that I can log errors for that session.
   - As a user, I want to view a list of all my sessions so that I can track my progress over time.
   - As a user, I want to view details of a specific session (e.g., errors logged, opponent, date) so that I can analyze my performance.

3. **Error Tracking**:
   - As a user, I want to log the number of unforced errors for a session so that I can keep track of my mistakes.
   - As a user, I want to view a summary of my errors (e.g., total errors, trends over time) so that I can identify areas for improvement.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - As a user, I want to see charts and graphs of my error data so that I can visualize my progress.
   - As a user, I want to compare my errors across different sessions or opponents so that I can understand patterns.

5. **Mobile-Friendly Design**:
   - As a user, I want to use the app on my mobile device so that I can log errors during or after a match.
   - As a user, I want the app to work offline so that I can log errors even without an internet connection.

6. **Sharing Data**:
   - As a user, I want to share my session data with my coach so that they can review my performance.
   - As a coach, I want to view my player’s shared session data so that I can provide feedback.

## **Functional Requirements**

### **1. User Authentication**
- Users can sign up with an email and password.
- Users can log in and log out.
- Users can reset their password if forgotten.
- Users can share their data with others (e.g., coaches) via a shareable link or email invitation.

### **2. Session Management**
- Users can create a new session with the following details:
  - Session name (e.g., "Match vs. John").
  - Opponent name (optional).
  - Date and time.
- Users can view a list of all their sessions.
- Users can view details of a specific session, including:
  - Total unforced errors.
  - Date and time.
  - Opponent name (if provided).

### **3. Error Tracking**
- Users can log the number of unforced errors for a session.
- Users can edit or delete logged errors.
- Users can view a summary of their errors, including:
  - Total errors per session.
  - Average errors per session.
  - Trends over time.

### **4. Data Visualization**
- Users can view the following charts:
  - **Line Chart**: Errors over time (e.g., by session or date).
  - **Bar Chart**: Errors by session or opponent.
  - **Pie Chart**: Error distribution by session or opponent.
- Charts are interactive and update in real-time as new data is added.

### **5. Mobile-Friendly Design**
- The app is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- The app supports offline functionality using local storage or IndexedDB.
- Data is synced with the backend when the app reconnects to the internet.

### **6. Sharing Data**
- Users can generate a shareable link for a specific session.
- Coaches or other users can view shared session data via the link.
- Shared data is read-only and cannot be edited by the recipient.

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **1. Performance**
- The app should load within 3 seconds on a mobile device.
- API responses should be delivered within 500ms.

### **2. Security**
- User passwords must be hashed and stored securely.
- JWT tokens must be used for authentication and have a reasonable expiration time.
- Shared session links must be secure and expire after a set period (e.g., 7 days).

### **3. Scalability**
- The backend should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- The database should be optimized for fast read/write operations.

### **4. Usability**
- The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Error messages should be clear and actionable.

### **5. Offline Support**
- The app should allow users to log errors offline.
- Offline data should be synced with the backend automatically when the app reconnects to the internet.

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Backend (Golang + PostgreSQL)**
- RESTful API with endpoints for:
  - User authentication (register, login, logout).
  - Session management (create, read, update, delete).
  - Error tracking (log, read, update, delete).
  - Data sharing (generate shareable link, view shared data).
- PostgreSQL database with tables for:
  - Users.
  - Sessions.
  - Errors.
- JWT-based authentication.

### **Frontend (React.js)**
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.
- Charts and graphs using Chart.js or Recharts.
- Offline support using local storage or IndexedDB.
- State management using React hooks or a library like Redux.

### **Deployment**
- Backend hosted on Google Cloud (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL).
- Frontend hosted on Vercel.
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. Add support for tracking different types of errors (e.g., forehand, backhand, serve).
2. Allow users to upload match videos and link them to sessions.
3. Add a coach dashboard for analyzing player data.
4. Integrate with wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) to automatically log errors.
